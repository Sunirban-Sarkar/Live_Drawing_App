# Live_Drawing_App
A Live Drawing Android App where we can draw on the screen with our finger by using hundreds of particles, expand the drawn particles, or clear the screen of all particles for a new drawing simultaneously.

There is an unsigned debug apk attached in the releases for debugging and testing on physical devices.
